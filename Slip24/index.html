A historic site or heritage site is an official location where pieces of political, 
military, cultural, or social history have been preserved due to their cultural heritage 
value. Historic sites are usually protected by law, and many have been recognized with 
the official national historic site status. A historic site may be any building, 
landscape, site or structure that is of local, regional, or national significance. 
Usually this also means the site must be at least 50 years or older.
